In the US, detective stories more often involve the police or the adventures of a 'private eye' (= private detective), and are often more violent and realistic. Famous US writers of such stories include Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and Elmore Leonard. Detective stories are also known as 'detective fiction' or 'crime fiction' and informally as ' whodunnits' (or 'whodunits').",
